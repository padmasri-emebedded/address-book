Project Overview
A console-based address book application developed in C that manages personal contacts. This application allows users to add, search, edit, delete, and list contacts through a user-friendly menu interface. The system initializes with dummy contacts for testing purposes.
Features

Add Contacts: Add new contacts with details like name, phone number, email, etc.
Search Contacts: Find contacts using string pattern matching for efficient searching
Edit Contacts: Modify existing contact details
Delete Contacts: Remove contacts with proper array element shifting to maintain data integrity
List Contacts: Display all saved contacts in an organized format

Technologies Used

C Programming Language
Struct Data Structures
Static Arrays
Standard I/O Functions
String Manipulation
Header File Organization
Preprocessor Directives
Control Structures

Key Learnings

Implemented efficient contact search with string pattern matching
Developed robust command-line debugging techniques
Solved logic errors related to contact deletion, which required correctly shifting array elements to maintain data integrity

Future Improvements

Implement persistent storage with file I/O
Add sorting capabilities by different fields
Enhance the search algorithm for better performance
Create a more advanced filtering system
